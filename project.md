${{ content_synopsis }} This image will run netbird from a single image (not multiple) [rootless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/rootless.md) and [distroless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/distroless.md) for more security. Due to the nature of a single image and not multiple, you see in the [compose.yaml](https://github.com/11notes/docker-netbird/blob/master/compose.yaml) example that an ```entrypoint:``` has been defined for each service. This image also needs some environment variables present in your **.env** file. This image's defaults (management.json) as well as the example **.env** are to be used with Keycloak as your IdP and Traefik as your reverse proxy. You can however provide your own **management.json** file and use any IdP you like and use a different reverse proxy.

The init binary **management** will replace all variables in the format ```${VARIABLE}``` with all environment variables present in the service.

${{ github:> [!CAUTION] }}
${{ github:> }}* Because this image is distroless, it only works with PostgreSQL, **not SQLite**. The GeoLocation middleware is also disabled because of this!
