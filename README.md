Run netbird rootless and distroless from a single image.

# INTRODUCTION üì¢

NetBird combines a WireGuard-based overlay network with Zero Trust Network Access, providing a unified open source platform for reliable and secure connectivity. Create your own selfhosted ZTNA mesh network.

# SYNOPSIS üìñ
**What can I do with this?** This image will run netbird from a single image (not multiple) [rootless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/rootless.md) and [distroless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/distroless.md) for more security. Due to the nature of a single image and not multiple, you see in the [compose.yaml](https://github.com/11notes/docker-netbird/blob/master/compose.yaml) example that an ```entrypoint:``` has been defined for each service. This image also needs some environment variables present in your **.env** file. This image's defaults (management.json) as well as the example **.env** are to be used with Keycloak as your IdP and Traefik as your reverse proxy. You can however provide your own **management.json** file and use any IdP you like and use a different reverse proxy.

The init binary **management** will replace all variables in the format ```${VARIABLE}``` with all environment variables present in the service.

# UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION üí∂
**Why should I run this image and not the other image(s) that already exist?** Good question! Because ...

> [!IMPORTANT]
>* ... this image runs [rootless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/rootless.md) as 1000:1000
>* ... this image has no shell since it is [distroless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/distroless.md)
>* ... this image is auto updated to the latest version via CI/CD
>* ... this image has a health check
>* ... this image runs read-only
>* ... this image is automatically scanned for CVEs before and after publishing
>* ... this image is created via a secure and pinned CI/CD process
>* ... this image is very small

If you value security, simplicity and optimizations to the extreme, then this image might be for you.

# MAIN TAGS üè∑Ô∏è
These are the main tags for the image. There is also a tag for each commit and its shorthand sha256 value.

* [0.54.1](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/netbird/tags?name=0.54.1)

### There is no latest tag, what am I supposed to do about updates?
It is of my opinion that the ```:latest``` tag is dangerous. Many times, I‚Äôve introduced **breaking** changes to my images. This would have messed up everything for some people. If you don‚Äôt want to change the tag to the latest [semver](https://semver.org/), simply use the short versions of [semver](https://semver.org/). Instead of using ```:0.54.1``` you can use ```:0``` or ```:0.54```. Since on each new version these tags are updated to the latest version of the software, using them is identical to using ```:latest``` but at least fixed to a major or minor version.

If you still insist on having the bleeding edge release of this app, simply use the ```:rolling``` tag, but be warned! You will get the latest version of the app instantly, regardless of breaking changes or security issues or what so ever. You do this at your own risk!

# REGISTRIES ‚òÅÔ∏è
```

# PARENT IMAGE üèõÔ∏è
> [!IMPORTANT]
>This image is not based on another image but uses [scratch](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch) as the starting layer.
>The image consists of the following distroless layers that were added:
>* [11notes/distroless:curl](https://github.com/11notes/docker-distroless/blob/master/curl.dockerfile) - app to execute HTTP requests
>* 11notes/distroless:nginx

# BUILT WITH üß∞
* [netbirdio/netbird](https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird)

# GENERAL TIPS üìå
> [!TIP]
>* Use a reverse proxy like Traefik, Nginx, HAproxy to terminate TLS and to protect your endpoints
>* Use Let‚Äôs Encrypt DNS-01 challenge to obtain valid SSL certificates for your services

# CAUTION ‚ö†Ô∏è
> [!CAUTION]
>* Because this image is distroless, it only works with PostgreSQL, **not SQLite**. The GeoLocation middleware is also disabled because of this!

# ElevenNotes‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
